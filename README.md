# Getting started with Blinky on mbed OS

This is a very simple guide, reviewing the steps required to get Blinky working on an mbed OS platform.

Please install [mbed CLI](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli#installing-mbed-cli).

## Get the example application!

From the command line, import the example:

```
mbed import mbed-os-example-blinky
cd mbed-os-example-blinky
```

### Now compile

Invoke `mbed compile` specifying the name of your platform and your favorite toolchain (`GCC_ARM`, `ARM`, `IAR`). For example, for the ARM Compiler 5:

```
mbed compile -m K64F -t ARM
```

Your PC may take a few minutes to compile your code. At the end you should get the following result:

```

```

### Program your board

1. Connect your mbed device to the computer over USB.
1. Copy the binary file to the mbed device .
1. Press the reset button to start the program.

You should see the LED of your platform turning on and off.

Congratulations if you managed to complete this test!

## Export the project to Keil MDK and debug your application

From the command line, run the following command:

```
mbed export -m K64F -i uvision
```

To debug the application:

1. Start uVision.
1. Import the uVision project generated earlier.
1. Compile your application and generate an `.axf` file.
1. Make sure uVision is configured to debug over CMSIS-DAP (From the Project menu > Options for Target '...' > Debug tab > Use CMSIS-DAP Debugger).
1. Set breakpoints and start a debug session.

## Troubleshooting

1. Make sure `mbed-cli` is working correctly and its version is greater than `0.9.1`

 ```
 mbed --version
 ```

 If not, you can update it easily:

 ```
 pip install mbed-cli --upgrade
 ```

2. If using Keil MDK, make sure you have a license installed. [MDK-Lite](http://www.keil.com/arm/mdk.asp) has a 32KB restriction on code size.
